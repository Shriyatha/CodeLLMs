1. Consider using recursion to solve the problem. Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself until it reaches a base case, which is an input that can be solved directly without further recursion. In this case, you could use recursion to calculate the factorial of a number by multiplying it with the factorial of one less than the number.
2. Think about how you can use a loop to iterate over the input. While recursion is a valid approach, using a loop might be more intuitive for beginners. A `for` loop could be used to process each element in the list and check if it's even or odd.
3. You might need to keep track of an accumulator variable that stores the running total of the factorial. This variable can be initialized to 1, as any number multiplied by 1 is still equal to itself. Then, for each iteration of the loop, you can multiply the current value of the accumulator with the input number and update it accordingly.
