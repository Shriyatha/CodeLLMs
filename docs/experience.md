# Project Experience

This project was a great opportunity to apply modern tools and frameworks for building an interactive learning system. Some of the highlights and challenges faced during the development of the **Code Gym** project include:

## Challenges
- **Docker Integration**: Managing isolated environments for both Python and JavaScript execution was tricky, especially when ensuring secure execution and handling potential errors.
- **Course Data Management**: Using YAML/TOML files to define course structures and loading them dynamically presented an interesting challenge, particularly with nested structures for topics and test cases.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Implementing an effective feedback system, including both visible and invisible test cases, required careful orchestration between the backend logic and frontend display.

## Achievements
- **Automated Code Grading**: Successfully integrated Docker for code validation, ensuring that student submissions are isolated and securely tested.
- **LLM Integration**: Incorporated Code LLM features to assist students with hints, error explanations, and conceptual scaffolding, enriching the learning experience.
- **Workflow Automation**: Implemented Prefect to automate grading workflows, reducing manual intervention and ensuring scalable, repeatable processes.

This project greatly improved my skills in Docker, FastAPI, Prefect, and integrating machine learning workflows with real-time systems.
