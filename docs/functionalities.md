# 🏋️‍♂️ Code Gym: Train Your Brain, Not Just Your Biceps

Welcome to **Code Gym** — where Python 🐍 and JavaScript 💻 flex their muscles and students level up through hands-on coding workouts, powered by LLM sidekicks 🤖.

---

## 📚 What’s Inside?

- **2 Courses**: Python & JavaScript  
- **5+ Topics per Course**: Loops, I/O, OOP… you name it  
- **3 Difficulty Levels**: Easy 🟢, Medium 🟡, Hard 🔴  
- **30 Problems per Course**: Powered by YAML/TOML — no hardcoding!

---

##  Problem Flow

1. Pick a **course** → a **topic** → a **difficulty**
2. Get the **problem**, starter code & visible test cases
3. Write & submit code 🧑‍💻
4. Code runs in a secure **Docker** container 🐳
5. Feedback:
   -  Visible test cases: pass/fail
   -  Invisible test cases: verdict only
   -  Syntax/runtime errors: explained!

##  LLM Features (Smart, Not Spoiler-y)

-  **Progressive Hints**: Step-by-step nudges
-  **Error Decoder**: Human-speak error explanations
-  **Scaffolding**: Break down big problems into bite-sized bits
-  **Code Reviews**: Style, performance, and best practices
-  **Socratic Prompts**: "Did you think about edge cases?"
