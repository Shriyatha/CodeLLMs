# Code Gym Project

Welcome to the **Code Gym** project! This platform helps students self-learn programming languages such as Python and JavaScript. The system allows students to select a course, pick a topic, and solve problems with varying complexities. Code submissions are evaluated automatically using Docker containers, and students receive feedback with detailed error explanations and hints.

## Features
- **Courses**: Python and JavaScript
- **Topics**: 5 topics per course, with problems categorized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- **Validation**: Code is validated against visible and invisible test cases, ensuring comprehensive feedback.
- **Code LLMs**: A range of Code LLM features such as progressive hints, error explanations, and code reviews.
